- Require more holistic approach with a knowledge of relevant signals
- Optimized content now relates to overall page concept not keywords
- topic association and semantic analysis allow for better content
- SEOs must deal with the shifting methods of keyword research and optimization

## Strengthening Your Keyword Strategy

### Topic Association

  "used by search engines to determine relevancy and trustworthiness"

- Search engines analyze contextual meaning to find relevance to topic/theme
- Page should contain keywords relevant to focus keyword, rather than repeating the focus keyword, Examples;

  + Winemaking: wine, vineyard, wine growing, wine production
  + Support: learn, instructors, students, tuition
  + certification: course, class, lecture, program, certificate

- Long-tail optimization

  + Where can I learn to make wine?
  + How do I get a certificate in winemaking?

- Focus keyword can be broken up into synonyms and other elements
- What other ways can I describe the theme?
- What other words would be relevant?
- What other words support the page topic?
- Page should contain supporting keywords
- Having content that has a cohesive theme results in "long tail keywords"
  + Long-tail keywords are longer words or phrases - difficult to predict but very targeted
- Algorithm was updated to check for relevancy and semantic relationships
  + Semantic analysis looks at how words are related
  + After Hummingbird, semantic and related results were even clearer

## How Does Branding Influence Website Rank?

  + Contact form
- Established history (domain registration time) and visible intent to continue doing business

- Bidding on paid keywords for brand names is a strong signal
- Brand keywords drive better conversions in paid search

### How to do SEO for a Brand Recognition?
