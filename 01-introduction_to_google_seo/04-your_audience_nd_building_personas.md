# Persona Development

> Creating a representation of your ideal target user

## Why is it Important to SEO?

- Buyer persona helps to identify user's needs and how they search
- Create content around topics they want
- Important in keyword research

## Where To Start?

- Existing customers or users
- Have bought your product or used your services already
- Use existing tools
- Reaching out to users directly

### Existing Tools: Google Analytics

- Demographics
- Interests based on other websites they visit
- What search engine they use
- What device they use
- What pages are the most popular
- Click maps of where users click the most within a page
- What pages they tend to exit your site on, and more

### Existing Tools: Google Search Console/Google Webmaster Console

- Mainly gives site performance stats

### Existing Tools: Survey Existing Users

- In-app messages
- Emailing past customers
- Request in a newsletter

### Existing Tools: Ask your Support and Sales Teams

- As they regularly deal with customers and potential buyers
- What questions are they asked about?

## Persona

- User profile
- Average age
- Income
- Type of job
- Photo or likeness

# Marketing to Your Persona

  Two Core Persona Types

- Potential Buyers
- Existing Customers

## Potential Buyers

- Not aware of your product or services yet
- Searching for solutions to a problem
- Create content to solve their issues

## Existing Customers

- Currently, shop or use your service
- What do they like best? Improvements?
- Create content to engage and retain them

## Using Keywords to Mine Data

- Help define your user and build out your persona
- Discover potential search queries you can match to content topics

# Getting to Know Your Audience

## Google Trends

- Presents geographic data which helps us target Keywords
- Helpful for content that may generate lots of social shares
- Gives topic ideas for site content

### Demographic Data

- Provides topic and keyword ideas
- Provides additional insight & helps to better optimize sites
- Demographics data is not 100% reliable
- Websites providing such data:
  + Alexa
  + quantcast
  + Google Analytics

#### Alexa

- Shows top keyword traffic for a site
- Audience insights help create user centered content

#### SimilarWeb

- Shows potential topics users might be interested in
- Shows traffic sources giving you ideas of where to promote content

#### Social Media Demographics

- Followerwonk helps analyze Twitter info
- Data is reliable as it is taken from Twitter (as reliable as Twitter :-)
- Twitter profiles/info can be fake
- Followerwonk cannot always identify follower gender

# Creating Your Ideal Buyers Persona

## Buyer Personas

- Fictional characters representing specific users of a website
- Personas help build user-centered sites & incorporate correct keywords naturally
- Create multiple personas to appeal to a variety of buyers

> Couple of questions about our buyers

- Persona's Age
  + Age could impact keyword choices due to lexicon differences

- Persona's Location
  + Persona's location Important in case of regional vocabulary differences

- Persona's Gender
  + Buyer's gender can influence vocabulary
  + Gender plays a larger role in than just their vocabulary
  + Sites might need a persona for both genders

- An image of a person brings your persona to life
- Add lots of details, since it will guide your site optimization
- Add additional information for your reference if applicable
  + for example: Is it a B2B or B2C persona?
